# NeuralWeb
A trainable Web of neurons, acting as a toy model of biological brains

Simply import the WebClass and use it to create a "Web". You tell it where to put the neurons and how close they must be to connect, it will create the Web and show it to you. You can then pass it a list of True/False values as input and a seperate list as desired outputs. Everytime you give it new inputs and desired outputs it will learn a little more.
